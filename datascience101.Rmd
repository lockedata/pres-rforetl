# Business Challenge
## Business Challenge/goal
- Increase customer profitability
- Increase quantity of customers
- Reduce overheads

## Data science challenge
Find the lever you can push on to change behaviours that helps with business goal.

## Getting started
### Tips
- Pick something only somewhat important and valuable to begin
- Find many levers

# Process

## Getting started
### Tips
- Iterate
- Prototype

### Next steps
- Check out [Experiment kanban](https://medium.com/lean-product-development/kanban-boards-for-hypothesis-driven-development-32f99a70e8ee)
- Check out [MSFT data science process](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/learning-paths/data-science-process/)

# Data & EDA
## Data
- Do you have enough data?
- What biases are in the data that you might end up reinforcing?
- Have there been changes over time that mean the information means different things?
- Does it actually measure what you think it's measuring?

## Extra data
- Where can you get extra information from?
- Do the join criteria work?
- Will you be able to get it for production purposes?

## Exploration
- Analyse the heck out of that data!
- Create extra "features"

## Visualisation
```{r}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,aes(x,y))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~dataset) +
  theme_void()
```
