# Business Challenge
## Business Challenge/goal
- Increase customer profitability
- Increase quantity of customers
- Reduce overheads

## Data science challenge
Find the lever you can push on to change behaviours that helps with business goal.

## Getting started
### Tips
- Pick something only somewhat important and valuable to begin
- Find many levers

# Process

## Data science routes
![](https://github.com/stephlocke/lazyCDN/raw/master/RHighlevel.png)

## Getting started
### Tips
- Iterate
- Prototype

### Next steps
- Check out [Experiment kanban](https://medium.com/lean-product-development/kanban-boards-for-hypothesis-driven-development-32f99a70e8ee)
- Check out [MSFT data science process](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/learning-paths/data-science-process/)

# Data & EDA
## Data
- Do you have enough data?
- What biases are in the data that you might end up reinforcing?
- Have there been changes over time that mean the information means different things?
- Does it actually measure what you think it's measuring?

## Extra data
- Where can you get extra information from?
- Do the join criteria work?
- Will you be able to get it for production purposes?

## Exploration
- Analyse the heck out of that data!
- Create extra "features"

## Visualisation
```{r}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,aes(x,y))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~dataset) +
  theme_void()
```

## Getting started
### Tips
- Data dictionaries
- Code everything

### Next steps
- Read R for Data Science [geni.us/rfords](//geni.us/rfords)
- Use your existing tools

## Example code
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

driver   = "ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server"
server = "lockedata.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
database = "datasci"
uid = "u001"
pwd = "HBBFSE"

dbConn<-dbConnect(odbc(),
          driver=driver, server=server,
          database=database, uid=uid,
          pwd=pwd)
```

## Example code
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dbplyr)
 
flights<-tbl(dbConn,"flights")
carriers<-tbl(dbConn,"flights_carriers") 

flights %>% 
  inner_join(carriers)
```

## Example code
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(skimr)
flights %>%
  collect %>% 
  skim()
```


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(skimr)
nycflights13::flights %>%
  skim()
```


# Sampling
## Sampling basics
- [OPTIONAL] Dataset for missing data
- Dataset for building your model
- Dataset for testing your model

## Considerations
- Balanced or unbalanced
- Bootstrapping

## Getting started
### Tips
- Make samples reproducible
- Don't double-dip!

### Next steps
- Read about [sampling](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/designing-studies/sampling-methods-stats/a/sampling-methods-review)

## Example code 
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(modelr)
flights %>% 
  resample_partition(c("train"=0.7,"test"=0.3))  ->
  samples

samples %>% 
  map(nrow)
```
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(modelr)
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  resample_partition(c("train"=0.7,"test"=0.3)) ->
  samples

samples %>% 
  map(nrow)
```

# Modelling
## Models
- Supervised vs unsupervised
- Parametric vs non-parametric

## Models
- Regression
- Trees
- Others

## Candidate models
- Simple model
- Complex model
- Different model types

## Getting started
### Tips
- Models are cattle not pets

### Next steps
- Check out [setosa.io](http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/)

## Example code
```{r echo=TRUE}
samples %>% 
  pluck("train") %>% 
  lm(arr_delay ~ as.factor(month) + as.factor(day) + hour , data=.) ->
  initial_lm

initial_lm
```

# Evaluation
## Critical Success Factors
- False positives vs false negatives
- Ranking
- Aligns with experts

## Data diving
- Segments
- Structural weaknesses
- Test data

## Getting started
### Tips
- Don't just rely on single metric

## Example code
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(broom)
initial_lm %>% 
  glance()
```

# Operationalising
## Features
- ETL for new data and calculations
- What data quality stuff had to be done?

## Model
- How will you store the model?
- Does it need versioning?
- When will it need to be updated and how?

## Technology
- What's the easiest way of getting live?
- What's the long term way of getting it live?
- What's your "bus factor"?

## Getting started
### Tips
- KISS
- Operationalising a model often takes longer than the modelling exercise (at least initially)

### Next steps
- Check out R in SQL Server
- Check out Azure ML

# Monitoring
## Logging
- Log results
- Log all the things

## Metrics
- Measure the business lever & other KPIs
- Set tolerances for negative impacts on other metrics
- J-performance

## Holdouts
- Always have a control group

## Getting started
### Tips
- Plan for monitoring, don't make it an after-thought
